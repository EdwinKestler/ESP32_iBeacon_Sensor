# ESP32_iBeacon_Sensor

Search on Aliexpress for an nrf52832 iBeacon Sensor that looks like the one in the image. It has tiny temperature, humidity and accelerometer sensors on it. Next use any ESP32 board to view the sensor data. Each iBeacon appears to have a different mac addess so view the sensor on your RLBeacon phone app and match them up.
